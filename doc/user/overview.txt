This package contains the original C++ code of MAppleT, which is not maintained
anymore. A new implementation has been written in Python to be used within 
**OpenAlea** framework. This python implementation is called **Stocatree** and 
provides a LSystem (similar but not identical to MAppleT) that can be used with
**LPy** 

See the user guide and reference guide for more information about installation and
usage.
